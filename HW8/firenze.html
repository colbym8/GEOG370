    <h2>Florence Transportation Network</h2>
    <p>"How has the government in Florence and Tuscany built transportation infrastructure<br>
        to connect the population centers of the region?" and "How will I navigate Tuscany<br>
        when I'm studying abroad in Florence this fall?"<br></p>
    <p>I'm an environmental science major studying smart cities and regional planning<br>
    (possibly with a concentration on transportation) and I'm generally interested in<br>
    transportation systems, Italian culture, and traveling. This is going to be my<br>
    first experience outside of the United States, so I wanted to make a map featuring<br>
    the different transportation lines in the Florence Metro Area, including major<br>
    roads, railways, biking paths, and walking paths. Hopefully my three semesters of<br>
    taking Italian will pay off when I'm trying to understand these transportation lines<br>
    this fall.

    <br><p>This map shows all of the different transportation systems mentioned above, combined<br>
    in one layer as a transportation 'network'. I also displayed the cities and towns,<br>
    with their population ranges, in the region surrounding Florence.<br>
    I used five different vector layers to create one (1)Union layer that incorporated all<br>
    of the systems into the network shown on the map. Then I used (2)Trim to create layers<br>
    of Italian cities and Italian transportation lines that existed only inside the Florence<br>
    metro area boundaries.<br>To create the reference/location map in the top right corner,<br>
    I also used (3)Dissolve to create a polygon layer without the internal political boundaries<br>
    the shapefile I downloaded originally had, creating an outline of Italy (because I was<br>
    somehow struggling to find an outline).</p>
