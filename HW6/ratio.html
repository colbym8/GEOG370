    <h3>Equal Count Scale</h3>

    <p>This map uses an equal count scale, meaning the 254 counties in the state of<br>
        Texas are divided evenly into five different classes. Equal count categorization<br>
        creates a map with equal representation of the five classes, however it can skew<br>
        how the data is perceived in the case of outlier counties being grouped with<br>
        counties of much larger or smaller magnitudes. Another limitation could be two<br>
        counties with similar employment participation values being placed in two different<br>
        classes because they fall at the minimum value of one class and the maximum value<br>
        of another.

    <h3>Equal Interval Scale</h3>

    <p>This map shows a WGS84 mercator projection in which the size and shape<br>
        become distorted at longitudes of higher magnitudes. This map creates line of<br>
        longitude and latitude that are parallel to one another as to create grid of<br>
        squares. Area and distances are both distorted.
